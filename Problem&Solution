Problem:

According to our company’s current recruitment and personnel management, our group raised the following points that can be improved

- If there are many interviews, it is easy to cause a conflict of interview time
- The results of the interviewer need to be delivered manually, which can not directly measure the ability of each candidate
- Candidates can not intuitively understand the recruitment process
- Can't completely control the whole recruitment process, can't carry out collaborative recruitment
- The whole recruitment process can not be completely recorded, which is prone to errors
- Lack of tracking and systematic management of employee training and certification

Solution:

The following is our analysis and implementation of this platform。

First is the function introduction：
- Interviewees can submit resumes, conduct written examinations, and check the progress of the interview on the website. The system can automatically screen resumes based on big data. The interviewer can score the interviewee according to his performance, and write a comment to record the shortcomings of the interviewee, so as to compare his performance in the second interview
- Another function of this system is talent management. Enter each candidate's information into the system. In addition, even if the candidate fails the interview or voluntarily withdraws, he will be tracked and investigated, such as his next company and position. These data are entered into the database and encrypted. Through this function, it is easier for the human resources department to weigh the salary of each employee.

The second is the technologies we plan to use:
- Regarding technical implementation, we have now decided to use Python as a programming language and Flask as a lightweight framework for back-end architecture.This combination makes it easier to crawl data and build systems
- We decided to complete front-end development with AngularJS, which has a solid foundation and community support. And it was a relatively complete front-end framework that made it easy to write reusable code, which was very helpful to our development team.

Finally, Cisco Personnel System Management Platform will have the following advantages

- Our company will have its own talent pool to quickly find suitable talents
- Display the analysis report according to the examiner's comments, and make a clear and accurate comparison of the results
- The interviewer can check the interview result in the system
- Simplify the personnel and manual process, and replace running around with online application and approval
- Analyze, plan and improve personnel management level
